[vgg_face_caffe] contains a caffe model - "VGG face" descriptor trained on LFW (http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) dataset.
[vgg_face_tensorflow] contains a tensorflow model converted from the caffe one.
[papers] contains two papers highly related to our project.

Here are two questions to be solved:
1. How to conbine the input 2D label vectors with 3D noise image (structure of conditional GAN)? 
2. How to use .caffemodel or .tfmodel in back-propogation?
